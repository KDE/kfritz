2008-12-28:

  * A call to Config::SetupFonbookIDs now deletes a previously instantiated 
    FonbookManager to allow multiple calls to SetupFonbookIDs in case of 
    configuration changes.
  * Introduced new method CallList::DeleteCallList() to explicitly delete the 
    singleton instance.

    activate this feature.                                                                  
  * Introduced new method CallList::CreateCallList() to explicitly pre-fetch 
    the call list before calling CallList::getCallList().
  * Moved Config::SetupFonbookIDs to FonbookManager::CreateFonbookManager().
  * Renamed Tools::GetPhoneSettings() to Tools::GetLocationSettings().
  * Added resolving of SIP[0-9] to real provider names.
