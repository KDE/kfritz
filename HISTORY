2008-12-28:
- Adapted to changes in libfritz++
  * A call to Config::SetupFonbookIDs now deletes a previously instantiated FonbookManager to allow multiple calls to SetupFonbookIDs in case of configuration changes.
  * Introduced new method CallList::DeleteCallList() to explicitly delete the singleton instance.

  * Introduced new method CallList::CreateCallList() to explicitly pre-fetch the call list before calling CallList::getCallList().
  * Moved Config::SetupFonbookIDs to FonbookManager::CreateFonbookManager().
