Fritz!Box call monitor for KDE 'kfritz' Revision History
--------------------------------------------------------

2008-12-21: Initial program

- First KDE based approach of a callmonitor for Fritz!Boxes
- Bases on libfritz++, part of vdr-fritz Plugin for the VideoDiscRecorder VDR.

2010-02-11: Version 0.0.1

- Updates in libfritz++
  * Made CallList a singleton.
  * Renamed various methods in fonbook classes from *Fonbuch* to *Fonbook*.
  * Implemented in-library msn filtering and reverse-lookups.
  * Renamed various methods in FonbookManager from *Fonbuch* to *Fonbook*.
  * Introduced callType::ALL to get one complete call list (containing missed, 
    incoming and outgoing)
  * Moved callType to CallEntry
  * A call to Config::SetupFonbookIDs now deletes a previously instantiated 
    FonbookManager to allow multiple calls to SetupFonbookIDs in case of 
    configuration changes.
  * Introduced new method CallList::DeleteCallList() to explicitly delete the 
    singleton instance.

    activate this feature.

    the call list before calling CallList::getCallList().
