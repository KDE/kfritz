*Description*
A KDE program for users of AVMs Fritz!Box to get call signaling and other 
functions.

This program has the following features:

    * Call notification

      KFritz connects to the Fritz!Box to inform you about incoming calls. 
      Detailed configuration is possible either in the KFritz user interface 
      or KDE's system settings.

      To enable this feature you have to dial "#96*5*" with a telephone 
      connected to the Fritz!Box. This works for all firmware versions 
      >= xx.03.99

      You may experience problems when trying to dial "#96*5*" with an ISDN 
      telephone. In such a case try to activate "auto keypad", "dial * and #" 
      or some similar setting in your ISDN telephone. If your ISDN telephone 
      contains no keypad support simply use an analogue telephone instead.

      If you do not want to be notified by every call, you can specify a list 
      of MSNs you are interested on in the plugin\'s setup. Max. 22 monitored 
      MSNs are supported.

    * Phone book support

      KFritz supports multiple phonebooks. You can configure which phonebooks 
      are used. The order matters with respect to number lookup. When a call 
      comes in, the plugin tries to resolve the number using the first 
      configured phonebook. If that fails, it tries the second one, and so on.

          o Fritz!Box phone book

            This accesses the Fritz!Box phonebook stored on the box itself.

          o das-oertliche.de/nummerzoeker.com phone books

            This tries to resolve any number via online directories.

          o Local Phonebook

            This is a local CSV file. It must be called "localphonebook.csv" and 
            has to be placed in $KDEHOME/share/apps/kfritz/. Each line contains 
            one entry in the following format: "«name»,«type»,«number»". «type» 
            has to be replaced with a type code (1=home, 2=mobile, 3=work).


    * Fritz!Box call list

      Shows the call history. Missed calls are indicated in KDE's system bar.
